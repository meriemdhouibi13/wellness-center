### 1. For filtered views by category
- Collection: `classes`
- Fields:
  - `category` (Ascending)
  - `status` (Ascending)
  - `startTime` (Ascending)

### 2. For date-based views
- Collection: `classes`
- Fields:
  - `status` (Ascending)
  - `startTime` (Ascending)

## Creating the Indexes

1. Go to the Firebase Console: https://console.firebase.google.com/
2. Select your project
3. Go to Firestore Database â†’ Indexes tab
4. Click "Add Index"
5. Fill in the details for each index as described above
6. Click "Create index"
